->I have created 3 copies of server instances running in port 3000,3001,3002.
->In the client code, I have inserted all the key value pairs through put method. I have retrieved value of key 9(hardcoded)
by get method. To retrieve value of other key , please pass key as an input to the method getVal().


For httpRouter package : 

I have downloaded httprouter folder from github and kept it in the same directory where my .go files are running. so I have changed import path for the httprouter to relative path of the folder. To successfully execute the go files , we have to keep httprouter folder inside server folder where .go files are kept.
